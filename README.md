## Data Problem
The purpose of this study aims to determine the most desirable attributes in a person that people look for when searching for a potential partner, using popular Classification Models such as KNN, Decision Trees and Random Forest. More than ever, people are connected to others through their electornics and smart phones, but the frequency of face to face interaction is on the downtrend, resulting in many feeling growing feelings of social anxiety and second guessing their social ability. This project aims to help classify what is seen as desirable in modern society to help people navigate the information age.
